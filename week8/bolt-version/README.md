# Developer Journal (Bolt Version)

This project was generated using [bolt.new](https://bolt.new).

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Supabase (or LocalStorage for MVP)

## How to Run
1.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  Start the dev server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Notes on Generation
- The initial prompt was: "Create a Developer Journal app with a dark mode UI."
- Bolt successfully created the UI but I had to manually fix the `uuid` import.
